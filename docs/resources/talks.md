# 访谈与演讲

## [No Priors Ep. 39 | With OpenAI Co-Founder & Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever (2023.11.2)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft0gTO2K85A)

OpenAI首席科学家Ilya Sutskever的访谈，个人觉得他是一个能看到未来的的科学家。Ilya的观点和老师Hinton的观点比较接近，对AI可能造成的后果持担忧态度，并且非常重视AGI的对齐工作。

> 1. The idea of training bigger networks on bigger datasets dates long before the discovery of scaling law of BERT model.
>
> 2. GPT model family was built, because **OpenAI had a clear vision of how the first AGI system would look like**, it should be some kind of large, power-hungry data center. Those incremental academic progress was just not the way AGI would be.
>
> 3. Sutskever finds the fact that scaling up neural networks works at all to be the most surprising, given their history of failure.
>
> 4. Super alignment is the effort to ensure future super-intelligent AI systems have pro-social attitudes towards humanity.

有AGI的世界会和之前的世界很不一样，抛开那些很宏大的话题，从每个人的角度来思考，个人觉得未来属于那些如何能够处理好和AGI的关系，来不断获得自我发展的人。也许就像老一辈人不太适应智能手机一样，我们这一辈人也许在后辈看来，也是不太能适应AGI的存在。

## [Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li in conversation (2023.10.7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14IsFbAbpI)

两位学者从行业内推动者与见证者的角度讨论了AlexNet到ChatGPT这十年AI以及神经网络的发展历程，以及现状和未来。

> Some interesting points:
>
> 1. Foundation models are called foundation because of its multi-task nature, no humans can learn in such multi-task nature as those foundation models do(backpropagation on massive data).
> 2. There is urgency about alignment research. People should make an effort to make sure strong foundation models benefit human race.
> 3. The future might belong to people who understand how to utilize foundation models as tools for their personal development. While over-reliance on such models might have some negative impact on education, the best students know how to use those models wisely.
> 4. Prof. Hinton believes in Turing test, and that LLMs such as GPT-4 really have understood language and the world. Prof. Li, on the other hand, disagrees.

> 1. LLMs open up a new research eco-system, and will be an important part of it.

难得的由OpenAI内部的学者向公众介绍RLHF的技术，能看出OpenAI在RLHF方面的努力与积累。

## [Steve Jobs' Stanford Commencement Address (2005)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hd_ptbiPoXM)

> Quotes:
>
> 1. You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.
> 2. You’ve got to find what you love. The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
> 3. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
> 4. Stay hungry, stay foolish.

> Quotes:
>
> 1. Humans are tool makers. Personal computer is the bicycle of mind.
> 2. Take the best, spread it around, so that everybody grows up with better things.

## [Geoffrey Hinton and Fei-Fei Li in conversation (2023.10.7)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E14IsFbAbpI)

两位学者从行业内推动者与见证者的角度讨论了AlexNet到ChatGPT这十年AI以及神经网络的发展历程，以及现状和未来。

> Some interesting points:
>
> 1. Foundation models are called foundation because of its multi-task nature, no humans can learn in such multi-task nature as those foundation models do(backpropagation on massive data).
> 2. There is urgency about alignment research. People should make an effort to make sure strong foundation models benefit human race.
> 3. The future might belong to people who understand how to utilize foundation models as tools for their personal development. While over-reliance on such models might have some negative impact on education, the best students know how to use those models wisely.
> 4. Prof. Hinton believes in Turing test, and that LLMs such as GPT-4 really have understood language and the world. Prof. Li, on the other hand, disagrees.

> Quotes:
>
> 1. You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward.
> 2. You’ve got to find what you love. The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.
> 3. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.
> 4. Stay hungry, stay foolish.
